# Medline-Solution
A scorecard web-based application created as a solution for my client, Medline. Previously, ad-hoc methods were used so I and my team collaborated on this application. I had never used REACT before, and having the opportunity to be the driver of changing html web pages into React was very challenging but exciting! I had a great time with this!
